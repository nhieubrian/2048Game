# 2048Game

This project is a personal project inspired off of the original 2048 game. I plan on using Java to create the backend while using JavaFX to create the UX design of the project, which will display the game when ran in a terminal.

This project is getting forgetten from balancing my two jobs :/... Glad I was able to get some work in today. Completed the constructors and a few functions. I need to figure out how to combine the tiles.
